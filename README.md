Linux CLI Bash scripts for technical SEO, cybersecurity, and web engineering. 

# CLI SEO & Infrastructure Tools

This repository contains short Bash scripts that I use to inspect websites from the command line.

The goal of my scripts is to provide clarity, verification, and truth from the system itself.

## seo-headers.sh

Checks:
- HTTP status chain
- Redirect count
- Final destination URL
- Server header

Usage:
./seo-headers.sh example.com

Why this exists:
SEO, security, and infrastructure overlap.
I observe and verify digital behavior directly from the CLI instead of relying on plugins or dashboards.

For site-check.sh
Input domain only. Do not include protocol.
